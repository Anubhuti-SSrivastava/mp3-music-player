# mp3-music-player

Music washes away the dust of everyday life from the soul. 
The saying was indeed true. We all love music. 

In our daily life, we see every person has a hobby and that is listening to music. 
So in order to listen to music, they all need a Music player(hardware or software) where they can play their favorite songs. 
And we have to install this music player on our computer, based on the Operating system i.e Windows, Macintosh, Android, Linux, etc.
Then we can listen to our favorite song
in this python project, we are going to create an mp3 player with the help of python and its libraries.


We will be using Python and its libraries.
The first library that we will be using is Tkinter which is a widely used GUI library offered by python, we do not have to install it separately, as it comes with python itself.

Next, we will be using the mixer module of a very famous python library called Pygame.


In our daily life, everyone has a hobby of listening to music. 
In order to listen to music we all need a music player. So letâ€™s build our own music player in python.
